# nem_history_timeline
Visual timeline of the NEM


This is an experiment in publishing a visual timeline of the NEM (and earlier) based on the [astrollytelling project](https://astrollytelling.github.io).

To dos:
1. Proof of concept with html structure and layout
2. Github Pages
3. Configure Google Analytics
4. Add a hovering menu bar at all stages, with clickable years
5. Look at improving layout for mobile, modernisation improvements to the jQuery library?

Test if the commit git sync is working in both directions.
